Lightweight window mover and resizer for Windows via keyboard shortcuts

Under development

Keybinds (eventually customizable):
- ALT+SHIFT+2+(UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT) = 1/2 of monitor
- ALT+SHIFT+3+(UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT) = 1/3 or 2/3 (alternating)
- ALT+SHIFT+4+(UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT) = 1/4 or 3/4 (alternating)
- ALT+SHIFT+1+(2|3|4)+(UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT) = Action of those above but locked to one dimension (ie UP|DOWN does not affect width)
- ALT+SHIFT+F = Fullscreen
- ALT+SHIFT+C = Centered (no resizing)
- ALT+SHIFT+(UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT) = Move window by same pixels as length/width, or to edge of monitor, whichever is closer (no resizing)
